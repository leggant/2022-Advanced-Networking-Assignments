## Overview 
Tyrell Corp is opening a new head office site. You have been asked to provide a submission for the  network LAN and WAN design as per the following customer specifications. Your predecessor had agreed a base design for both the LAN and WAN, however there are a number  of decisions to be made and full design specification to be supplied including proof of concept  configurations and testing. Refer to the LAN diagram in the appendix. 
### Special Note 
> This assessment has a special emphasis on critical evaluation. This means that where possible you  are to describe why you have chosen the various features / technologies and give consideration for   alternative solutions. Use the customer questions / requirements below in red to guide you. 

## Head Office LAN Network - Customer Specifications

The customer requires a hierarchical design with discrete Access, Distribution and Core layers providing for availability, scalability and security.
You are tasked with designing: 

  - The Core layer
  - WAN edge block
  - User access block

The core design must allow for additional distribution blocks to be added in the future. 

### User Departments 

The user access block will provide for 4 main departments. Each department will exist within its own  subnet. You have been allocated the network range **10.7.0.0/16** to cater for all required subnets  including point to point addressing and management.
  - Admin (12 staff)
  - Sales & Marketing (60 staff)
  - HR (20 staff)
  - Finance (20 staff) 

Growth for each department is not expected to exceed 100%.

### Subnetting

The customer has requested that subnet allocations are easy to summarise, understand and support. 
1. You must describe why this is true for your design.
    I have created the subnets using /24 CIDRs. These are commonly used, have a large number of user IP addresses which can be allocated in future as needed. End user subnets start at the 10.7.1.0/24 and end at 10.7.4.0/24. The 10.7.0.0/24 address space has been allocated to point-to-point connections, this makes it easier to keep track of addresses that are exclusively for the network infrastructure. This also keeps a large address space in reserve for future expansion of the network. An additional subnet has been created for loopback addressing, these addresses are to be allocated as needed for routing and testing purposes. Unused address space has approx. ____ IP addresses unused.
2. You must provide documentation that lists each of the IP Subnets (including L3 links) and what they are used for. 

| Subnet Name | Allocated Size | Address  | Mask | Dec Mask      | Assignable Range      | Broadcast  |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------- | ---- | ------------- | --------------------- | ---------- |
| P2P         | 254            | 10.7.0.0 | /24  | 255.255.255.0 | 10.7.0.1 - 10.7.0.254 | 10.7.0.255 |
| Finance     | 254            | 10.7.1.0 | /24  | 255.255.255.0 | 10.7.1.1 - 10.7.1.254 | 10.7.1.255 |
| Marketing   | 254            | 10.7.2.0 | /24  | 255.255.255.0 | 10.7.2.1 - 10.7.2.254 | 10.7.2.255 |
| Admin       | 254            | 10.7.3.0 | /24  | 255.255.255.0 | 10.7.3.1 - 10.7.3.254 | 10.7.3.255 |
| Sales       | 254            | 10.7.4.0 | /24  | 255.255.255.0 | 10.7.4.1 - 10.7.4.254 | 10.7.4.255 |

**Consider** how device management addressing will be allocated. Ensure some point-to-point /30  networks are set aside for the WAN design.

### Access

The companyâ€™s existing LAN deployments utilise L2 VLANS and STP from the distribution layer to the  access layer, however the company will consider layer 3 to the access layer.

3. You are to decide if the access to distribution will be layer2 or layer3 and provide an argument that considers both pros and cons of your decision. 

    The access to distribution will be layer 3. 

    **Cons of Layer 3:**

    - Higher cost of access layer hardware

    **Pros of Layer 3:**

    - Faster processing of IP packets

        Layer 3 devices do not use spanning tree, VLANs. This free CPU processing capacity, allowing routing to occuring much faster

    - Routing and switching is handled internally without the need to be transmitted to a router 

    The additional cost of adding this hardware to the network is  investment 

4. You are to decide if VLANs need to be spanned across access switches or if each access  switch will have a dedicated user VLAN. Why have you made this decision? 

Each switch will have a dedicated user VLAN, this ensures traffic is separated. Layer 3 switches can be divided so that physical connections to the layer 3 can still be made. 

**Note** this decision will influence if the link between the distribution switches is L2 or L3. 

### Resilience 
The HO LAN is to provide redundant links and paths where possible while minimising convergence  time. The design needs to consider the impact of a switch failure.

5. The customer requests you describe traffic flow and how it is affected by at least three  potential failure scenarios. Use diagrams to indicate primary and alternate traffic paths in  the event of device and or link failures.
6. You are to explain how you are using ether channel and if not why?
7. Explain how have the core to distribution links been designed to minimise convergence? 
8. Alternatively if you are using a layer 3 access then describe how you have done this including  the routing protocol used and how the routing metrics have been configured and why. How  does this impact the ability to have redundant host default gateways? 


### Routing

You must specify an appropriate interior gateway protocol to be used for internal routing within the HO site. The interior routing protocol will be used between the Distribution layer, Core layer and  edge routers.

**OSPF selected**

10. Explain why you have chosen the IGP?
11. Explain how you have configured the IGP including methods you have employed to minimise  convergence time, optimise traffic flow and limit the wasting of bandwidth and CPU calculations. 

### Security

The customer has asked you to consider security.
12. Are there any security features that should be deployed within the new HO LAN? Explain  your choices. 

## Customer Specifications - WAN Connectivity 

### Design 
The WAN core is a service provider managed MPLS service. The HO LAN will connect to the WAN via two separate connections. The WAN links to the provider are 100Mb Ethernet. Ensure to design the WAN connectivity and routing as per the customer requirements below. 

Refer to the WAN diagram in the appendix. 

### ISP IP Addressing 
The ISP has allocated two point-to-point networks of 172.16.17.0/30 & 172.16.17.4/30 for the Head  Officeâ€™s WAN links to the service provider. 
172.16.17.12/30 has been allocated for the Liverpool WAN link. 172.16.17.16/30 has been allocated for the Fulham WAN link. 
Use 172.16.17.8/30 for the link between the Provider Edge routers. 

### Liverpool Site 
The remote Liverpool site is included for routing testing purposes. The LAN IP address range is 10.8.0.0/16. You will specify this range in any policy, filtering, routing etc  as needed. 

### Fulham Site 
The remote Fulham site is included for routing testing purposes. The LAN IP address range is 10.9.0.0/16. You will specify this range in any policy, filtering, routing etc  as needed. 

### BGP AS Numbering
The MPLS Core BGP AS is 4700 The Head Office has been allocated BGP AS 65007 Liverpool has been allocated BGP AS 65008 Fulham has been allocated BGP AS 65009

### Routing - HO LAN to Service Provider
You are required to use BGP to connect the head office site to the ISP. The company has purchased an active / active service offering from the provider. This means that the company can choose which link to use on a per subnet basis. 
You are to configure BGP policy on the HO LAN WAN Routers such that:
For inbound traffic from the Service Provider (& other attached sites) to the HO LAN networks, Link 1 (see appendix diagram) will be used as the primary path. Traffic will route over Link 2 if the primary path fails. Only a summary route of the Head Office LAN networks is to be advertised to the ISP via the primary and backup paths.

Outbound traffic from the HO LAN network to the Liverpool site will use Link 2 as primary and Link 1 as backup.

Outbound traffic from the HO LAN network to the Fulham site will use Link 1 as primary and Link 2 as backup.

13. You are to specify and describe how BGP will be configured to accomplish the above including detail of which BGP attributes are used and why and how the HO LAN networks are summarised.
14. You are to ensure the Head Office cannot be used as transit between any other Service Provider attached sites. Explain how you have achieved this.
15. You are to ensure end to end connectivity between the HO user VLANs and Liverpool and Fulham sites. Provide evidence of this.

### Security 

The customer has asked you to consider security. 
16. Anti spoof (URPF or ACL) not break Asymmetric traffic 
17. You are to choose at least two additional security features that should be deployed on the  WAN routers (not related to VTY or console passwords)? Explain your choices.
